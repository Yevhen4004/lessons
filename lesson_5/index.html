				Transformers.

			<p>
				Transformers is a media franchise produced by American toy company Hasbro and Japanese toy company
				Takara Tomy. It primarily follows the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two alien robot
				factions at war that can transform into other forms, such as vehicles and animals. The franchise
				encompasses toys, animation, comic books, video games and films. As of 2011, it generated more than ¥2
				trillion ($25 billion) in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

			Transformers: Generation 1
		</h2>
		<div class="block-two">
			<p>
				Generation One is a retroactive term for the Transformers characters that appeared between 1984 and
				1993. The Transformers began with the 1980s Japanese toy lines Micro Change and Diaclone. They presented
				robots able to transform into everyday vehicles, electronic items or weapons. Hasbro bought the Micro
				Change and Diaclone toys, and partnered with Takara.
			</p>
			<p>
				Marvel Comics was hired by Hasbro to create the backstory; editor-in-chief Jim Shooter wrote an overall
				story, and gave the task of creating the characters to writer Dennis O'Neil Unhappy with O'Neil's
				work (although O'Neil created the name "Optimus Prime"), Shooter chose Bob Budiansky to create the
				characters.

		<div class="block-three">
			<p>
				The Transformers mecha were largely designed by Shōji Kawamori, the creator of the Japanese mecha anime
				franchise Macross (which was adapted into the Robotech franchise in North America). Kawamori came up
				with the idea of transforming mechs while working on the Diaclone and Macross franchises in the early
				1980s (such as the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Robotech), with his Diaclone mechs later providing the
				basis for Transformers.

			Transformers: Generation 2
		</h2>
		<div class="block-four">
			<p>
				It was five issues of the G.I. Joe comic in 1993 that would springboard a return for Marvel's
				Transformers, with the new twelve-issue series Transformers: Generation 2, to market a new toy line.
			</p>
			<p>
				This story reveals that the Transformers originally breed asexually, though it is stopped by Primus
				because it produced the evil Swarm. A new empire, neither Autobot nor Decepticon, is bringing it back,
				however. Though the year-long arc wrapped itself up with an alliance between Optimus Prime and Megatron,
				the final panel introduced the Liege Maximo, ancestor of the Decepticons. This minor cliffhanger was not
				resolved until 2001 and 2002's <mark>Transforce</mark> convention when writer Simon Furman concluded his
				story in the
				exclusive novella Alignment.
